        <p>
            When we updated Magic List to include the new <i>Activity Tracker</i> system, we
            got rid of the <i>Appointment Set</i> contact status, and replaced it with the the
            <i>Introduction</i> and <i>Inventory Statuses</i>.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Since Magic List does not know which status to migrate these prospects to, please set
            the status for them. Note, it won't change the time at which you contacted them.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have <b><span id="migration-count">@migrationCount</span></b>
            contacts left to migrate.
